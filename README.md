# Custom Scikit Learn ML block example for Edge Impulse

This repository is an example on how to bring a [custom machine learning model](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/adding-custom-transfer-learning-models) into Edge Impulse. This repository contains a small logistic regression model built with Scikit Learn.

As a primer, read the [Adding custom transfer learning models](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/adding-custom-transfer-learning-models) page in the Edge Impulse docs.

This is highly WIP.
